# Zomato Restaurant Data Analysis

This is a beginner-friendly project where I analyzed Zomato restaurant data using Google Colab.  
I explored trends in ratings, cuisines, and cost, and created simple visualizations to show insights.

**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Google Colab

To run the project, open the `.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab and run the cells step by step.
